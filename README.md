# Chess with heuristics
 We have three players in `src`. Each player use one of the flowing algorithms. Those players are not good for example they do not distinguish between start, middle and end of the game. 

# Algorithms used:
  - Random algorithm.
  - Minimax algorithm with Shannon's heuristic.
  - Alpha-Beta algorithm with Shannon's heuristic.
